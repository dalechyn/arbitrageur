# Session 12

Continuing testing the contract and the application.

Found that liquidity-overweight logic is bad, and found out that the price after trade computed by the program does not really correspond to the real price after the contract execution is made.
Need to check again how ticks are crossed, and if I made any mistake with ticks.

I.E: 

- current tick: 116846
- next tick within one word: 153499
- real next tick: 121212

Computed amounts do not correspond the real next tick!

But wait. It actually does!

The loss is in price which causes differenc is in left/right closest tick!

fuck yeah

V2-V3 perfected
V3-V2 not sure
