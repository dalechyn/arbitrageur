But another problem was found. The algo calculates the amounts for the **maximum** profit,
but a situation where one of the pools (aka pairs) doesn't have enough liquidity for a flash swap (a full profit trade) does exist on low-liquidity pairs. The algo should check if there is enough reserves for the full profit value, and if not - use the full reserves amount for the flash swap
