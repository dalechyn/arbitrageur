# Session 13

I'm analyzing the beloved contract again to find out what are those 1 and 0 passed as two last parameter on method 0x00000052.

I found out that when bot makes an arbitrage UniV3-UniV2 the last args are:
- 0
- 1

When swaps V2-V2 it's:
- 1
- 1

When swaps V2-V3 it's:
- 1
- 0

I believe those are the internal indeces of the dex swap which indicate from which DEX type to which the arbitrage should be made.

Also it's funny enough he didn't manage pack those values in two bits of one arg. lol. extra 256bytes of unoptimized calldata.
