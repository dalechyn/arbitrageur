# Session #1

## Tasks
1. Understand why are transactions sent bypassing the mempool, are private miners mine blocks faster rather than regular ones?

    What % of all of the transaction of the account 0x5aa3393e361c2eb342408559309b3e873cd876d6 taken in a certain date range are sent bypassing mempools?
2. Define a list of blockchains to research swap protocols on
2. Get the list the swap protocols on different blockchains

## Results
1. MEV-based attacks are focused on transaction ordering for creating front-running/back-running/sandwich attacks which steal profit opportunity from market makers.
   
   Flashbot are focused to keep transaction ordering stale by providing additional ETH (bribe) to the miner directly.

## Thoughts
1. So called "bribe" can be calculated by taking the latest gas price?
   Though [this](https://fifikobayashi.medium.com/beginners-guide-to-troubleshooting-mev-on-flashbots-aee175048858) page suggests to use `block.coinbase.transfer()` to pay the bribe
   only when the transaction succeeds.
   
   UPD: Probably works for BSC. For ETH, EIP1559 should  be applied with base miner fee.
