I've spent some time to understand theory behind Uniswap V3, as it
is needed to implement the next step

## Calculating amount of tokens to swap

Custom formula is needed for every swap
to find out amount of tokens to be swapped to extract the maximum profit,
and to get two pools at a price equilibrium.

The problem is that UniswapV3 introduced a way more complex
definition of what a pool is, however some alredy gave a shot
to solving this particular problem: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/120828/uniswap-v3-calculate-volume-to-reach-target-price
