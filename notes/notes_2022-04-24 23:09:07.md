# Session 5

I managed to write code but can't test it as I need to fetch tick data

https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/blob/main/src/hooks/usePoolTickData.ts#L62

Uniswap frontend fetches 125 surrounding ticks from the left and right.

But how much is enough for us?
...

At now, all ticks are being fetched.

Now I'm getting `NOT_CONTAINED` error after binary search lookup

So probably I have to fill `ticks` with empty ticks but according to `tickSpacing`
