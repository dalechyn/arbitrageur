# Session 9

Haven't been here for 13 days, forgot a lot I did here.

However, while I was testing WETH-DAI pair I found a huge price gap which I executed by hands
and got 7.4ETH. Enough for tests.


The reason I was stuck a bit that there are two cases when finish price is detected.

If V2 liquidity >> V3 liquidity, it's easier to move V3 tick price to uniswap price (the tick choosen however is closest, so the algo is not precise enough!!! Does it need to correct the liquidity from V2 to V3 in this case?)
Imagine the V2 price is 11.034 but the closest tick is 11.033. There is still a price difference in 0.001 basis points, but however, it won't be profitable as movement of V2 liquidity is too expensive. So I chose to stick with price inaccuracy in that case

Another case is when V3 liquidity >> V2 liquidity, and the conditions are the same. We are able to move V2 liquidity much easier to extract the remaining value by staying in the same tick, but moving the V2 price up to that tick.

What a fucking writer I am. If someone reads it he will probably spent hours to understand what I wrote here.
I don't give a fuck however.


Then I chose to test WETH-UNI pair, and got a successful trade.

However the amount is too big to test for me, so I checked WETH-USDC pair and got next results:
```
Balancing pools, V3 price: 23753.8 ⬇️, V2 price: 10843.2 ⬆️
Balancing pools, V3 price: 14070.4 ⬇️, V2 price: 13756.7 ⬆️
