# Session 3
## UniswapV2 - UniswapV3 example:
UniswapV2 has a single pool for a pair of tokens, whereas UniswapV3 can have multiple pools.

That means, that the first thing that needs to bec checked - single pool pairs.

Let's say, UNI-WETH price on UniswapV2 is 0.5

And on UniswapV3: 0.7, 0.6, 0.9.

It's obvious that it's better to buy on UniswapV2 and sell on UniswapV3.

But the situation may be different

On UniswapV2: 0.9, UniswapV3: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2.

If we looked for highest price in the first case, we look for lowest price in the second place.

More saying - we don't care the direction, and price comparsion should met on the actual price comparsion, not by `lowest` param set before
