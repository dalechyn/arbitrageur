# Session 6

I need to understand how amounts in V3 Pool are treated within one tick

I think that when the swap makes price lower (token1/token0), and token1 is bought,
it takes tokens from liquidity of the lower amount

But how are fees applied to this?

Also need to find out a formula to get the amount of tokens to buy within one tick

$`\Delta`$
